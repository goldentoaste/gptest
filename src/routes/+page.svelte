Hey, its John. I just got a new number and Im having a hard time right now, can I borrow some money? <br/>
Just buy me a few gift cards so I can spend it easier.

   Now, I need your help to transfer this money out of the country
    so that we can share it equally. If you agree to assist me, I will provide
    you with all the necessary documents and information required to
    authenticate your involvement as a beneficiary. Once the funds are
    successfully transferred into your account, you will be entitled to 40% of
    the total sum, which amounts to an astonishing $10,000,000!
